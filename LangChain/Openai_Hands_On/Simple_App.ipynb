If you are on the Enterprise plan and have questions about cost optimization, contact your sales rep or support via support.langchain.com.\\n\\u200bUnderstand your current usage\\nThe first step of any optimization process is to understand current usage. LangSmith provides two ways to do this: Usage graph and Invoices.\\nLangSmith Usage is measured per workspace, because workspaces often represent development environments (as in the example), or teams within an organization.\\n\\u200bUsage graph\\nThe usage graph lets you examine how much of each usage-based pricing metric you have consumed. It does not directly show spend (which you will review later in the draft invoice).\\nNavigate to the usage graph under Settings -> Billing and Usage -> Usage Graph.\\nThere are several usage metrics that LangSmith charges for:\\n\\nLangSmith Traces (Base Charge): tracks all traces that you send to LangSmith.\\nLangSmith Traces (Extended Data Retention Upgrades): tracks all traces that also have our Extended 400 Day Data Retention.\\nLangSmith Deployment Runs: tracks end-to-end invocations of deployed LangGraph agents.\\n\\nFor more details on traces, refer to the data retention conceptual docs. For more details on Deployment Runs, refer to LangSmith Deployment billing.\\n\\u200bInvoices\\nTo understand how your usage translates to spend, navigate to the Invoices tab. The first invoice that will appear on screen is a draft of your current month’s invoice, which shows your running spend thus far this month.\\nLangSmith’s Usage Graph and Invoice use the term tenant_id to refer to a workspace ID. They are interchangeable.\\n\\u200bSet limits on usage\\n\\n\\u200bSet spend limit for workspace\\n\\nTo set limits, navigate to Settings -> Billing and Usage -> Usage limits.\\nInput a spend limit for your selected workspace. LangSmith will determine an appropriate number of base and extended trace limits to match that spend. The trace limits include the free trace allocation that comes with your plan (see details on pricing page).\\n\\nFor organizations with multiple workspaces only: For simplicity, LangSmith incorporates the free traces into the cost calculation of the first workspace only. In actuality, the free traces can be “consumed” by any workspace. Therefore, although workspace-level spend limits are approximate for multi-workspace organizations, the organization-level spend limit is absolute.\\n\\u200bConfigure trace tier distrubution\\nLangSmith has two trace tiers: base traces and extended traces. Base traces have the base retention and are short-lived (14 days), while extended traces have extended retention and are long-lived (400 days). For more information, refer to the data retention conceptual docs.\\nSet the desired default trace tier by selecting an option below the Default data retention label. All traces will have this tier by default when they are registered. Note that because extended traces cost more than base traces, selecting Extended as your default data retention option will result in less overall traces allowed in the billing period. By default, updating this setting will only apply to future incoming traces. To apply to all existing traces in the workspace, select the checkbox.\\nIf the default data retention is set to Base you can optionally use the slider to distribute trace limits across base and extended tracess. LangSmith automatically provides a suggestion for this distribution but you can tailor this to your needs. For example, if you are running lots of automations or other features that may upgrade a trace to extended, you may want to increase your extended trace limits. To see the complete list of features that may upgrade a trace, see here.\\nThe extended data retention limit can cause features other than tracing to stop working once reached. If you plan to use this feature, read more about its functionality and side effects.\\n\\u200bOther methods of managing traces\\n\\u200bChange project-level default retention\\nData retention settings are adjustable per tracing project.\\nNavigate to Projects > Your project name > Select Retention and select the desired default retention. This will only affect retention (and pricing) for traces going forward.\\n\\n\\u200bApply extended data retention to a percentage of traces\\nYou may not want all traces to expire after 14 days. You can automatically extend the retention of traces that match some criteria by creating an automation rule. You might want to apply extended data retention to specific types of traces, such as:\\n\\n10% of all traces: For general analysis or analyzing trends long term.\\nErrored traces: To investigate and debug issues thoroughly.\\nTraces with specific metadata: For long-term examination of particular features or user flows.\\n\\nTo configure this:\\n\\nNavigate to Projects > Your project name > Select + New > Select New Automation.\\nName your rule and optionally apply filters or a sample rate. For more information on configuring filters, refer to filtering techniques.\\n\\nWhen an automation rule matches any run within a trace, then all runs within the trace are upgraded to be retained for 400 days.\\nFor example, this is the expected configuration to keep 10% of all traces for extended data retention:\\n\\nIf you want to keep a subset of traces for longer than 400 days for data collection purposes, you can create another run rule that sends some runs to a dataset of your choosing. A dataset allows you to store the trace inputs and outputs (e.g., as a key-value dataset), and will persist indefinitely, even after the trace gets deleted.\\n\\u200bLangSmith Deployment billing\\nIn addition to traces, LangSmith charges for deployed agents via LangSmith Deployment (formerly LangGraph Platform).\\n\\nDeployment Runs: A one end-to-end invocation of a deployed LangGraph agent and is billed at $0.005 each. Nodes and subgraphs within a single agent execution are not charged separately. Calls to other LangGraph agents are charged separately to the deployment hosting the called agent. When using human-in-the-loop with interrupts, resuming after an interrupt creates a separate Deployment Run.\\nDeployment Uptime: You are also charged for the time your deployment’s database is live and persisting state. See the pricing page for uptime costs by deployment type (Development vs Production).\\n\\nFor high-volume deployment usage, please contact our sales team to discuss custom pricing options.\\n\\u200bSummary\\nIf you have questions about further managing your spend, please contact support via support.langchain.com.\\n\\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.Was this page helpful?YesNoManage your organization using the APIPreviousGranular billable usageNext⌘IDocs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesForumChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by\\n')]"

All traces will have this tier by default when they are registered.

By default, updating this setting will only apply to future incoming traces. To apply to all existing traces in the workspace, select the checkbox.\\nIf the default data retention is set to Base you can optionally use the slider to distribute trace limits across base and extended tracess. LangSmith automatically provides a suggestion for this distribution but you can tailor this to your needs. For example, if you are running lots of automations or other features that may upgrade a trace to extended, you may want to increase your extended trace limits.
