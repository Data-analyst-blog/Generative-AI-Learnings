1. What is a Time Series?

A time series is a sequence of observations recorded over time, usually at regular intervals.

Examples:
	•	Daily stock prices
	•	Monthly sales
	•	Hourly temperature
	•	Weekly demand

X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots, X_t


2. Key Components of a Time Series

Most time series can be broken into four parts:

(a) Trend (T)

Long-term direction of the series.
	•	Upward, downward, or flat
Example: Gradual increase in yearly sales.

(b) Seasonality (S)

Regular repeating patterns at fixed intervals.
	•	Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
Example: Ice cream sales higher every summer.

(c) Cyclic (C)

Longer-term ups and downs, not fixed length.
Example: Economic booms and recessions.

(d) Noise / Residual (R)

Random variation that cannot be explained.
Example: Unexpected spikes or drops.

\text{Time Series} = T + S + C + R


3. Types of Time Series

(a) Stationary

Statistical properties (mean, variance) do not change over time.

(b) Non-Stationary

Mean, variance, or pattern changes over time.
Most real-world time series are non-stationary.


4. Important Concepts

(a) Lag

A previous time step value.
	•	Lag-1 = value at t-1
	•	Lag-7 = value 7 days ago

(b) Autocorrelation

Correlation between a series and its past values.
Used to detect patterns and seasonality.

(c) Differencing

Subtracting previous value to remove trend:

Y_t = X_t - X_{t-1}


5. Common Time Series Models

(a) Naïve Forecast

Next value = last observed value.

(b) Moving Average

Smooths noise by averaging past values.

(c) ARIMA

AutoRegressive + Integrated + Moving Average.
Handles trend and autocorrelation.

(d) Exponential Smoothing (ETS)

Gives more weight to recent observations.

(e) Prophet

Good for business seasonality and holidays.

6. Forecasting Workflow
	1.	Visualize the data
	2.	Check trend & seasonality
	3.	Make series stationary (if needed)
	4.	Choose a model
	5.	Train the model
	6.	Validate performance
	7.	Forecast future values


7. Simple Example

Monthly sales:
Month           Sales
Jan             100
Feb             120
Mar             140

	•	Trend: Increasing
	•	Seasonality: None visible yet
	•	Lag-1: Feb uses Jan’s value
	•	Naïve Forecast for Apr: 140

In One Line

Time series analysis studies data collected over time to understand patterns (trend, seasonality) and make future forecasts.
