    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated objects of a common superclass. it provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces."

    "Polymorphism is a powerful feature of OOP that allows for flexibility and integration in code design. it enables a single function to handle objects of different classes, each with its own implementatio of a method. By understanding and applying polymorphism, you can create more extensible and maintainable object-oriented programs."
